GENERAL PROJECT GUIDELINES:
- To add a file to the project:
    - Make sure that its location is in the "Source" folder.
    - Add it with Introjucer.
- CPP files should have header files to go with them.
- In classes, public definitions should come before private definitions.
- Names of member variables should start with a lowercase m, as in mWaveData
