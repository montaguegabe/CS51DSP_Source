GENERAL PROJECT GUIDELINES:
- Always open the project through Introjucer!
- To add a file to the project:
    - Make sure that its location is in the "Source" folder.
    - Add it with Introjucer.
- CPP files should have header files to go with them.
- In classes, public definitions should come before private definitions.
- Names of member variables should start with a lowercase m, as in mWaveData
- The definitions for the SoundWave class should probably be split into multiple
  .cpp files. Use + to denote the specific functionality. For example,
  SoundWave+Fourier.cpp could be the file the implements the Fourier-related
  functions.

If you guys prefer one way of doing comments, brackets, pointers, etc. put it here.
